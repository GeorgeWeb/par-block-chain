# Optimising Block-chain Algorithm by adding parallelism

## Aim
parallelising a block-chain algorithm using multiple approaches

## Overview
The main idea of the project is to compare, analyse and discuss the parallelisation 
of the algorithm with every one of the mentioned methods with the use of helpful tools 
and techniques and such as profilers, scoped timers and plotting.

## Techniques used
- OpenMP
- Multi-Threading with Atomics
- Thread Pool using Futures

## How To Build
Use the CMakeLists.txt that is inside every implementation's folder and target your compiler of choice (must support C++17)
